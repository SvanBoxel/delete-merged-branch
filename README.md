A GitHub app built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that automatically deletes a branch after it's merged. That's it, enjoy! 

## Running it locally
1. First, follow [these instructions](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configure-a-github-app) for making your own GitHub app.
Give your app the following permissions:
    - Repository contents: Read & Write.
    - Pull requests: Read

2. Then, clone the repo:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:SvanBoxel/delete-merged-branch.git
```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the right environment variables as [here](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configure-a-github-app) 

4. Now, install app dependencies and run it:

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```

## How it works
This GitHub app listens to the `pull_request.closed` webhook. If a pull request is closed and the connected branch is merged, it will delete the branch.

## Configuration
The optional app configuration YAML file should be saved as `.github/delete-merged-branch-config.yml`. At the moment it supports the following options:

- `exclude` _(array)_ - list of branches that should not be automatically deleted after a merge. 

Example `.github/delete-merged-branch-config.yml`:

```
exclude: 
  - development
  - qa
```

## Release process
CI (Travis) is in charge of releasing new versions of the GitHub Application to [Now](https://zeit.co/now). On every new commit to master we run [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to determine whether the major/minor/patch version should be incremented. If so, we update the version running in production.

## Running in GitHub actions
This app is compatible with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). You need to create a workflow that is triggered on the `pull_request` event for this. Then, you use this repo for the action. (`SvanBoxel/delete-merged-branch@master`). Don't forget to check the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret. That's it.
